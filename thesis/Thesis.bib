  abstract = {Prediction of winners in the online video games has become an important application for machine learning based prediction models. The main goal of the present study is to achieve a good prediction rate for a popular Electronic sport called League of Legends. League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game that combines intensity of a Real-time strategy with various Role-playing elements. Feature selection is done and only relevant features that affect the match outcomes are considered. Prediction is done by using ensemble models of classification algorithms and the performance was evaluated. The important performance metrics and their influence on each game model were also analyzed. The results show that the reliable match result prediction is possible in the League of Legends game.},

  abstract = {Predicting results in electronic sports (e-sports) matches is not an easy task. Different methods can be used for this purpose. A well-known video game in the field of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) is the game League of Legends (LoL), which has a relevant professional scene. An important part of professional gaming is analyzing past matches overall and an individual player's performance to prepare for future matches. In this paper, we follow a design-oriented research methodology (analysis, design, and evaluation) and propose performance metrics that use data from past matches to evaluate a player's performance. We analyze the necessary data which we acquire by selecting a player, analyzing the player's latest games, and repeating the process recursively with the players found in his latest games. The data is utilized within a Machine Learning (ML) Model that computes an overall score from individual player variables. From this, we designed a heuristic approach and evaluated it by applying it to the challenge of winning predictions in e-sports. The difference in the influence of the individual player roles on the outcome of the game was also investigated. It was found that this difference is negligible and that the heuristic performance metric can predict the outcome of a game with an accuracy of 86\%. Furthermore, the concept of a match calculator is explored, which calculates the outcome of a match using the ML model and different player stats.},

To stay alive, players must closely monitor their character's status, especially remaining health. Understanding how health may change in the near future can be vital in determining what tactics a player may use. We analyzed replay logs of the game Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2) to discover methods to predict how players' health evolves over time. For DotA 2, our results suggest that forecasting changes in a player's health can be done by viewing gameplay as two separate processes: normal gameplay flow in which changes in health are smaller and more regular, and less frequent but higher-impact events in which players experience larger changes in their health, such as team battles. We accomplished this by considering health data as two separate, but interleaved, time series in which separate processes govern low magnitude changes in health from high magnitude changes. In this paper, we present a value-split approach to predicting changes in health and describe the results of our approach using autoregressive moving-average models for low magnitude health changes and a combination of statistical models for the larger changes.},

We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behaviour varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players.

Multi-player online battle arena games are among the most successful games in this regard. In order to execute complex team-based strategies, players take on very specific roles within a team. This paper investigates the applicability of supervised machine learning to classifying player behavior in terms of specific and commonly accepted but not formally well-defined roles within a team of players of the game Dota 2. We provide an in-depth discussion and novel approaches for constructing complex attributes from low-level data extracted from replay files. Using attribute evaluation techniques, we are able to reduce a larger set of candidate attributes down to a manageable number. Based on this resulting set of attributes, we compare and discuss the performance of a variety of supervised classification algorithms. Our results with a data set of 708 labeled players see logistic regression as the overall most stable and best performing classifier.},

  abstract = {A central problem in machine learning is identifying a representative set of features from which to construct a classification model for a particular task. This thesis addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation based approach. The central hypothesis is that good feature sets contain features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. A feature evaluation formula, based on ideas from test theory, provides an operational definition of this hypothesis. CFS (Correlation based Feature Selection) is an algorithm that couples this evaluation formula with an appropriate correlation measure and a heuristic search strategy.     CFS was evaluated by experiments on artificial and natural datasets. Three machine learning algorithms were used: C4.5 (a decision tree learner), IB 1 (an instance based learner), and naive Bayes. Experiments on artificial datasets showed that CFS quickly identifies and screens irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features, and identifies relevant features as long as their relevance does not strongly depend on other features. On natural domains, CFS typically eliminated well over half the features. In most cases, classification accuracy using the reduced feature set equaled or bettered accuracy using the complete feature set. Feature selection degraded machine learning performance in cases where some features were eliminated which were highly predictive of very small areas of the instance space.     Further experiments compared CFS with a wrapper - a well known approach to feature selection that employs the target learning algorithm to evaluate feature sets. In many cases CFS gave comparable results to the wrapper, and in general, outperformed the wrapper on small datasets. CFS executes many times faster than the wrapper, which allows it to scale to larger datasets.    Two methods of extending CFS to handle feature interaction are presented and experimentally evaluated. The first considers pairs of features and the second incorporates feature weights calculated by the RELIEF algorithm. Experiments on artificial domains showed that both methods were able to identify interacting features. On natural domains, the pairwise method gave more reliable results than using weights provided by RELIEF.},

This article addresses the prediction of the winning team in professional matches of the game, using only pregame data. We propose to improve the accuracy of the models trained with the features offered by the game application programming interface (API). To this end, new features are built to collect interesting information, such as the skills of a player handling a certain champion, the synergies between players of the same team or the ability of a player to beat another player. Then, we perform feature selection and train different classification algorithms aiming at obtaining the best model. Experimental results show classification accuracy above 0.70, which is comparable to the results of other proposals presented in the literature, but with the added benefit of using few samples and not requiring the use of external sources to collect additional statistics.},

Esports analytics has evolved to address the requirement for data-driven feedback, and is focused on cyber-athlete evaluation, strategy and prediction. Towards the latter, previous work has used match data from a variety of player ranks from hobbyist to professional players. However, professional players have been shown to behave differently than lower ranked players. Given the comparatively limited supply of professional data, a key question is thus whether mixed-rank match datasets can be used to create data-driven models which predict winners in professional matches and provide a simple in-game statistic for viewers and broadcasters. Here we show that, although there is a slightly reduced accuracy, mixed-rank datasets can be used to predict the outcome of professional matches, with suitably optimized configurations.},

This article evaluates the first professional-level prediction models for live DotA 2 matches, one of the most popular MOBA games, and trials it at a major international esports tournament. Using standard machine learning models, feature engineering and optimization, our model is up to 85\% accurate after 5 min of gameplay. Our analyses highlight the need for algorithm evaluation and optimization. Finally, we present implications for the esports/game analytics domains, describe commercial opportunities and practical challenges, and propose a set of evaluation criteria for research on esports win prediction.},

  abstract = {Esports have become major international sports with hundreds of millions of spectators. Esports games generate massive amounts of telemetry data. Using these to predict the outcome of esports matches has received considerable attention, but micro-predictions, which seek to predict events inside a match, is as yet unknown territory. Micro-predictions are however of perennial interest across esports commentators and audience, because they provide the ability to observe events that might otherwise be missed: esports games are highly complex with fast-moving action where the balance of a game can change in the span of seconds, and where events can happen in multiple areas of the playing field at the same time. Such events can happen rapidly, and it is easy for commentators and viewers alike to miss an event and only observe the following impact of events. In Dota 2, a player hero being killed by the opposing team is a key event of interest to commentators and audience. We present a deep learning network with shared weights which provides accurate death predictions within a five-second window. The network is trained on a vast selection of Dota 2 gameplay features and professional/semi-professional level match dataset. Even though death events are rare within a game (1\% of the data), the model achieves 0.377 precision with 0.725 recall on test data when prompted to predict which of any of the 10 players of either team will die within 5 seconds. An example of the system applied to a Dota 2 match is presented. This model enables real-time micro-predictions of kills in Dota 2, one of the most played esports titles in the world, giving commentators and viewers time to move their attention to these key events.},

With the rapid development of E-sports, the impact of data analysis on MOBA games is increasing. For example, data mining and deep learning methods can be used to guide players and develop appropriate strategies to win games. This paper proposes a novel MOBA game analysis system. The system includes three individual modules, namely lineup recommendation, real-time win rate prediction, and trend forecasting. The lineup module is implemented using NSGA-II algorithm to recommend hero combinations according to the enemy lineup. Win rate module is a neural network for predicting the quantitative advantage between teams. Trend module is a sequence-to-sequence model that forecasts the future team gold and exp. Finally, the system is applied to Dota 2, one of the most popular MOBA games. Experiments on a large number of professional match replays show that the system works well on arbitrary matches.},

It represents the relative difference in in-game abilities of players of the same position that leads to a significant difference between two teams in determining the loss/win of a particular match. However, no player seems to pay enough heed to if there is a difference between players who play the Support role (or "SP Diff" to be specific) which also may have also helped them to win a match. In most places, this role is considered insignificant among players. But do they really not contribute towards the winning of a match? In our research, we investigate the impact of a player who contributes in a Support role toward match victory. Previous researches show collective intelligence (CI) to be a factor in team games that helps to analyze their capacity to work and win collectively. To our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on the contribution of any single particular role out of the full team of five players toward the victory of a match. We also create a custom dataset based on the match statistics and match-specific performances of different Support role players and evaluate if the outcomes and performance shown by a particular role are crucial enough to the world of teams in competitive online video games, where intensive, self-organized, and time-pressured cooperation takes place entirely online. The results show a stronger correlation between a certain support player's performance and the match result than usually thought of. This points towards more reliable match result prediction in the game. We make the dataset publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joyanta180199/lol-sp},

A critical part of the game play involves choosing from a pool of more than one hundred heroes to form two five-players team. However, as different heroes have their unique attributes and skill sets, selecting a strong combination of heroes (i.e., hero drafting) is an challenging task for new players which requires extensive knowledge and experience. Previous studies have shown that using hero draft data alone can achieve as high as 69.8\% of accuracy in predicting game outcomes. However, many aspects in hero draft remains to be further investigated. In this study, we aimed to achieve higher accuracy by adding game length as an input feature. In addition, we used multi-layer feedforward neural networks to predict the game outcome with GPU enabled. However, the results showed that adding game length does not improve the performance significantly nor did neural networks outperform logistic regression significantly.},

This article proposes a set of evaluation indicators for testing gameplay in Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a popular multiplayer online game. The analysis shows that the multiplayer killing indicator is an effective predictor of the game result. Furthermore, the evaluation indicators are divided into two categories: operational skills and tactical awareness. The functions of the indicators in each category are discussed. The results show that, for professional eSports teams, tactical awareness affects the multiplayer killing indicator and the game result more so than operational skills.},

Combat in these types of games is highly-dynamic and can be difficult for novice players to learn. Typically, mastery of combat requires that players obtain expert knowledge through practice, which can be difficult to concisely describe. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for discovering patterns in combat tactics that are common among winning teams in MOBA games. We model combat as a sequence of graphs and extract patterns that predict successful outcomes not just of combat, but of the entire game. To identify those patterns, we attribute features to these graphs using well known graph metrics. These features allow us to describe, in meaningful terms, how different combat tactics contribute to team success. We also present an evaluation of our methodology on the popular MOBA game, DotA 2 (Defense of the Ancients 2). Experiments show that extracted patterns achieve an 80\% prediction accuracy when testing on new game logs.},

Consequently, many efforts have been devoted to providing pregame or in-game predictions for them. These predictions can be used in many MOBA esports-related applications, such as artificial intelligence commentator systems, in-game data analysis, and game-assistant bots. However, these works are limited in the following two aspects: the lack of sufficient in-game features and the absence of interpretability in the prediction results. These two limitations greatly restrict the practical performance and industrial application of the current works. In this work, we collect a large-scale dataset containing rich in-game features for the popular MOBA game Honor of Kings. We then propose to predict four types of prediction tasks in an interpretable way by attributing the predictions to the input features using two gradient-based attribution methods: Integrated Gradients and SmoothGrad. To evaluate the explanatory power of different models and attribution methods, a fidelity-based evaluation metric is further proposed. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy and fidelity of several competitive methods to assess how well machines predict events in MOBA games.},

MOBA-Slice is a quantitative evaluation method based on learning, similar to the value network of AlphaGo. It establishes a foundation for further MOBA related research including AI development. In MOBA-Slice, with an analysis of the deciding factors of MOBA game results, we design a neural network model to fit our discounted evaluation function. Then we apply MOBA-Slice to Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA2), a typical and popular MOBA game. Experiments on a large number of match replays show that our model works well on arbitrary matches. MOBA-Slice not only has an accuracy 3.7\% higher than DotA Plus Assistant at result prediction, but also supports the prediction of the remaining time of the game, and then realizes the evaluation of relative advantage between teams.},

This research uses Active Learning as the main method to evaluate the dataset that contains approximately ten thousand high-Elo ranked games. Then, the research compares the results of prediction based on our active learning algorithms and the random selection methods. The research experiment finally presents that the prediction result of the active learning model is similar to that of the traditional machine learning methods and outweigh the accuracy of random selection.

  abstract = {With an increasing popularity, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games where two opposing teams compete against each other, have played a major role in E-sports tournaments. Among game analysis, real-time winning prediction is an important but challenging problem, which is mainly due to the complicated coupling of the overall Confrontation1, the excessive noise of the player's Movement, and unclear optimization goals. Existing research is difficult to solve this problem in a dynamic, comprehensive and systematic way. In this study, we design a unified framework, namely Winning Tracker (WT), for solving this problem. Specifically, offense and defense extractors are developed to extract the Confrontation of both sides. A well-designed trajectory representation algorithm is applied to extracting individual's Movement information. Moreover, we design a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture team-level strategies and facilitate the interpretability of the framework. To optimize accurately, we adopt a multi-task learning method to design short-term and long-term goals, which are used to represent immediate state and make end-state prediction respectively. Intensive experiments on a real-world data set demonstrate that our proposed method WT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our work has been practically deployed in real MOBA games, and provided case studies reflecting its outstanding commercial value.},

  abstract = {There are significant benefits to serve deep learning models from relational databases. First, features extracted from databases do not need to be transferred to any decoupled deep learning systems for inferences, and thus the system management overhead can be significantly reduced. Second, in a relational database, data management along the storage hierarchy is fully integrated with query processing, and thus it can continue model serving even if the working set size exceeds the available memory. Applying model deduplication can greatly reduce the storage space, memory footprint, cache misses, and inference latency. However, existing data deduplication techniques are not applicable to the deep learning model serving applications in relational databases. They do not consider the impacts on model inference accuracy as well as the inconsistency between tensor blocks and database pages. This work proposed synergistic storage optimization techniques for duplication detection, page packing, and caching, to enhance database systems for model serving. We implemented the proposed approach in netsDB, an object-oriented relational database. Evaluation results show that our proposed techniques significantly improved the storage efficiency and the model inference latency, and serving models from relational databases outperformed existing deep learning frameworks when the working set size exceeds available memory.},
